            Being blind for 28 years has lead to an intimate knowledge of the ins and outs of assistive technology.
            Being a teacher for almost ten years has given him hands on experience with a wide range of people from
            military veterans training for jobs in the civilian world, to people in wheelchairs with
            physically-debilitating limitations. What's more, he's trained in a wide range of countries in at least
            three languages. This has lead to a unique interest with, a passion for, and love of helping people. In
            order to further this goal, Brando Collins launched into a three year study of the fundamentals of
            Accessible design.

    <h3>
        Self Defense
    </h3>
        <p>
            Starting at the age of four, Brando was taught Self Defense. Growing up, Judo, folk-style wrestling, and
            Chinese boxing were prevalent fields of study. He graduated from studying in community centers in Chicago to
            training with masters from around the world. One of the best ways to learn is to travel, and training trips
            took him to Asia, Australia, and South America.
