Starting at the age of four, Brando was taught Self Defense. Growing up, Judo, folk-style wrestling, and Chinese boxing were prevalent fields of study. He graduated from studying in community centers in Chicago to training with masters from around the world. One of the best ways to learn is to travel, and training trips took him to Asia, Australia, and South America.

        Brando has been blind for 28 years, (since the age of two). This has lead to an intimate knowledge of the ins and outs of assistive technology. Being a teacher for almost ten years has given him hands on experience with a wide range of people from military veterans training for jobs in the civilian world, to people in wheelchairs with physically-debilitating limitations. What's more, he's trained in a wide range of countries in at least three languages. This lead to a unique interest ant and love of helping people. In order to further this goal, Brando Collins launched into a three year study of the fundamentals of Accessible design.
